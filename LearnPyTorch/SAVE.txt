## Requirements/Prerequisites
Before attempting the ML tutorial, we encourage you to install `PyTorch` and `jupyter-notebook`.

You have two main ways to perform the installation:
- `Anaconda` base installation
- `Pip` base installation. 

### `Anaconda` base installation
For this installation process, you need to have the `Anaconda` python package manager installed on your laptop. It will be required to create a virtual environment for running the tutorial. You can download `Anaconda` from this [link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Once you have `Anaconda` on your computer, you first have to install the virtual environment using the command:
```
conda env create -f MARTA_ENV.yml
```
The file MARTA_ENV.yml is given in the repository source above. For more information about `Anaconda` environments, you can read [this](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment). Once all the packages defined in MARTA_ENV.yml (note that jupyter-notebook is already included) have been installed, you can activate the environment with, 
```
conda activate marta
```
### `Pip` base installation
In this approach, you can skip the installation of `Anaconda` and directly install the jupyter-notebook and PyTorch using pip (or pip3). For the installation of jupyter-notebook, you can have a look at [this](https://jupyter.org/install). For the installation of PyTorch, you can follow the instruction [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Select `Stable (1.13.1)`, your OS, `Pip` package, `Python` language, and `CPU` platform. We will not train your network on GPUs for the moment. 

## Launching the jupyter-notebook
Now that all required packages installed, you can launch the jupyter-notebook as, 
```
jupyter-notebook PyTorch_Tutorial1.ipynb
```
The file PyTorch_Tutorial1.ipynb is given in the repository source above.

For a _deeper_ introduction to a wide variety of neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks, transformers, encoder-decoders, graph neural networks, auto-encoders, ...), we recommand you the course [INFO8010 - Deep Learning](https://github.com/glouppe/info8010-deep-learning) given at ULiege. The professor Gilles Louppe has made a very nice GitHub where he links to its lectures and YouTube videos.
